Based on an idea from the 2020 NZ Hackathon

Small prototype for a routine app that would focus less on strict schedules and more on improving wellbeing habbits. The idea behind the app is to encourage users to have activities from each of the four categories of Hauora (wellbeing), and thus increasing their overall Hauora.

This app was created with Gatsby, and React DnD
